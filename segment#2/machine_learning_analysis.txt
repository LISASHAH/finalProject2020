# Restaurant Entrepreneur:  Predicting best type and location with Yelp Review Data

## Bill (an investor) went on a work trip recently in San Diego for a few days. During his stay, he really liked the restaurant options that were available. Being that he already had interests in opening up a restaurant for some time now, he wanted to know what the type of restaurant and where to open would be most successful.

## As a first look, our group decided to use Yelp API to collect data on the mix of restaurants across cities and states within the United States. In this case, we decided to use the review data that Yelp is known for. Since Yelp provides a wide variety of restaurant categories, it is possible to get more information in regards to reviews and ratings for all different types in each city.

## In our attempts to use Yelp API, we had issues with importing the Yelp API data. When we created a dataframe from the API, it would only pull a small portion of the data on each run, not a sufficient amount of data to do a full analysis on. Fortunately, we were able to find some recent Yelp Review data on Kaggle.com. 

## We began setting up our code by importing various libraries, which included Random Forest and DeepLearning Machine Learning Models. For the preprocessing, we imported StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder. The OneHotEncoder is needed as it creates a binary column for each category type of restaurant.

## The cleaned data is loaded into a postgres database. It is also formatted to fit the required format for Machine Learning during the transformation process. 

## We attempted using the Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning Model. This model is good if you want high performance with less need for interpretation. 

## We have also added the Deep Learning Model to get more neural network predictions. Deep Learning is known for itâ€™s supremacy in terms of accuracy when trained with huge amounts of data. 

## Created a dataframe, reading the data from SQL. We selected the columns to include the review_count, stars (which is the rating system Yelp uses on a scale of 1-5 stars), city, state, postal code, and category for type of food. We also organized all the reviews by postal code.

## From the new dataframe created, we then dropped the city and state columns and ran a count of each category type of restaurant food. There ended being a lot of category types so we had to create sub categories that were specific food items that actually fall under a more general category type of food to organize the data better.
