# Project Overview


 - Bill (an investor) went to work to visit NYC for a few days and he really liked the restaurant options that are available since he is interested in opening a restaurant business himself.  
 - In the few days he was in NYC, he was using the Yelp to choose different restaurants near his hotel. Bill is thinking about opening a restaurant in NYC as there is a lot of variations of food. Before he opens a restaurant, he is interested in learning more what types of restaurants are in NYC, what are the yelp reviews, and additional details that would help him open a restaurant.
