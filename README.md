# Final Project 

## First Segment 

This week's project focused on the selecting a project idea. The goal of this week was to decide on our overall project, selecting your question, building a model, finding a dataset, using a database using CSV or JSON files to prototype our idea. In this segment, we began by gathering a project team to help support the project.

### Background

As part of this project, we are woking with Bill, who is an investor in the west cost. Bill recently went to visit San Diego for a few days and he really liked the restaurant options that are available since he is interested in opening a restaurant business himself.  
In the few days he was in San Diego, he was using the Yelp to choose different restaurants near his hotel. Bill is thinking about opening a restaurant in San Diego as there is a lot of variations of food. Before he opens a restaurant, he wants to learn about the   about what types of restaurants are in San Diego, what are the Yelp review ratings (good or bad), what is the rating of the new resturants, and additional details that would help him open a restaurant. 

### Project Team 

Prior to starting the project, we put together a list of team members to support the project. 

1) Square - Responsible for setting up the repository. This includes naming the repository and adding team members (branches).
Primary: Ebrahim, Seghen

2) Triangle - Responsible for creating a simple machine learning model with these questions in mind. This can also be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps. Team members will focus on which model to use, methods to use on training the data for the model, and level of accuracy for the model.
Primary: Lisa, Knar, Seghen

3) Circle - Responsible for the mockup database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project. This includes a document that describes our schema of the database, which can be a markdown document or ERD. 
Primary: Knar, Justin, Lisa, Ebrahim

4) X - Focuses on what technologies will be used for each section of the project.

## Description of the source of data

The team is planning to connect to the Yelp API to conduct this analysis.
Business Details: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business
Detailed information of the businesses (restaurant id, location, address, phone number, price etc.) 
Business reviews: https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_reviews
Includes restaurant id, rating, user id, time created, text, etc. 


# Hypothesis 

Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between the type of restaurant type of restaurant NYC and review restaurant ratings  
Hypothesis: There is a correlation between the type of restaurant type of restaurant NYC and review restaurant ratings 
Dataset = Yelp or restaurant reviews
Label = rating

## Analysis Questions
We are hoping to answer the following questions:
- Predictive model ? Restaurant recommendation 
- Predict future reviews for a new restaurant based on the available data
- Predict what a reviewer will review for a specific data
- Predict what restaurants may close in near future and what will be an optimal business at that location
- Predict what restaurant to open where
